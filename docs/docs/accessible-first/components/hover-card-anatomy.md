---

:::intro{robot="anatomy" title="Look closer, when you want to"}
This page takes the hover card apart to show how design decisions become the parts you see. You don't need it to use the hover card: [its own page](../hover-card) has everything you need to build.

**Three easy ways in**

- Start with the drawing. Each number is one part, and the legend beside it names it.
- Want to know why a part looks the way it does? Its card follows the decision from the answer about the product, through the rule and the token, to what you see.
- Or start from a job, like Focus or Emphasis, and find every part that does it in the legend.

Come back whenever a part makes you wonder why.
:::

## Design roles

Each part does a job for the person. These are the jobs, as questions the part answers.

- **Containment** What holds this?
- **Layering** What sits on top?
- **Hierarchy** What do you read first?
- **Readability** Can you read it?
- **Emphasis** Where does the eye go?
- **Meaning** What state is it in?
- **Affordance** Can you act on it?
- **Feedback** Did it respond?
- **Focus** Where is the keyboard?
- **Grouping** What belongs together?
- **Reach** Can you hit it?

## The parts

:::panel{media="wide"}
![Hover card, every part numbered](/anatomy/accessible-first/hover-card/stage.png)
*Accessible first, light, drawn in Figma from the scheme's tokens.*

Legend: every part and its roles. The numbers match the drawing; a part without one isn't in this example.

:label[By scheme]{tone="info"} Its value changes by scheme. The part is the same in every scheme.

- **Trigger** required · a link of the page :label[Affordance]
- **Panel** required :label[Containment]
  - **1** **Surface** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Containment] :label[Layering]
  - **2** **Border** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Containment]
  - **3** **Shadow** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Layering]
- **4** **Content** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Readability]
- **Avatar** optional · shown by Avatar :label[Meaning]
- **5** **Offset** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Grouping]

## How the decisions reach each part

Each part follows a chain: an answer about the product, the rule it set, the token that carries it, and the value you see. The numbers match the drawing.

:::panel{id="part-1-2-3" title="Surface, border and shadow" note="Parts 1, 2, 3" media="side"}
![Surface, border and shadow: 1, 2, 3](/anatomy/accessible-first/hover-card/card-1.png)

:label[Containment] :label[Layering]

- **Answer** Elevation · What rises above the page? → Nothing

  Flat is easier to read at high zoom.

- **Answer** Elevation · How soft are shadows? → No shadows

  No shadows; borders do the work.

- **Answer** Shape · What should control corners say? → Slightly rounded

  Clear, slightly rounded controls.

- **Rule** For a menu or dialog, use A strong border and a dimmed page. Don't use a shadow only.

  The dimmed page makes the dialog obvious.

- **Token** `color.surface.raised` → `content.background` #FFFFFF · dark #141414 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Fills that float above content.

  - **Pick** neutral.0, the same as content (surface.default): a menu stands out by its edge alone, not by its fill.
  - **Dark** neutral.50, the same as content (surface.default): a menu stands out by its edge alone, not by its fill, as in light.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.default, action.secondary. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.surface.raised.

- **Token** `radius.surface` → `content.radius` 0.5rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** radius.8: Clear, slightly rounded controls.

- **Token** `color.border.default` → `content.border` #D6D6D6 · dark #333333 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Quiet edges and dividers. Decorative, so it has no contrast minimum.

  - **Pick** neutral.200: a quiet line that stays visible on every surface it meets (lowest 1.36:1, on surface.canvas). It decorates, so it holds no contrast minimum.
  - **Dark** neutral.200: a quiet line that stays visible on every surface it meets (lowest 1.46:1, on surface.default). It decorates, so it holds no contrast minimum.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.pressed, disabled.border. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.border.default.

- **Token** `border-width.default` → `content.border-width` 2px :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** border-width.2

- **Token** `elevation.overlay` → `content.shadow` 0px 0px 0px, #00000000 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** shadow.none: No shadows; borders do the work.
  - **Shares the step with** elevation.card. Changing this pick moves only what reads elevation.overlay.

- **Token** `space.inset.container` → `content.padding` 1.5rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** space.24

:::panel{id="part-4" title="Content" note="Parts 4" media="side"}
![Content: 4](/anatomy/accessible-first/hover-card/card-2.png)

:label[Readability]

- **Answer** Typography · How large is body text? → Large

  Large text is readable for more people.

- **Answer** Color · Which color roles does it need? → Surface, text, action and status

  Few color roles, each with one clear meaning.

- **Rule** For paragraph or help text, use type.body, short sentences. Don't use type.caption.

  Large text and short lines lower effort.

- **Token** `color.text.primary` → `content.label` #141414 · dark #F7F7F7 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Body text and headings.

  - **Pick** neutral.900: the strongest text step, 18.42:1 on surface.default, above the 7:1 floor.
  - **Dark** neutral.900: the strongest text step, 17.2:1 on surface.default, above the 7:1 floor.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.inverse. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.text.primary.

:::panel{id="part-5" title="Offset" note="Parts 5" media="side"}
![Offset: 5](/anatomy/accessible-first/hover-card/card-3.png)

:label[Grouping]

- **Answer** Spacing · How dense is the layout? → Spacious

  Space lowers effort and mis-taps.

- **Rule** For items that belong together, use space.gap.default. Don't use space.gap.tight.

  Generous space lowers mis-taps.

- **Token** `space.gap.tight` → `overlay.offset` 0.75rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** space.12

## For agents

Agents get this same anatomy: every part, its roles, whether it is required, the tokens it reads and the decisions behind them.

- **From an AI agent:** call the `get_anatomy` tool on the Open DS MCP server, with this scheme and `hover-card`.
- **From a terminal:** `npx open-ds anatomy accessible-first hover-card`
