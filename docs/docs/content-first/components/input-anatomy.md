---

:::intro{robot="anatomy" title="Look closer, when you want to"}
This page takes the input apart to show how design decisions become the parts you see. You don't need it to use the input: [its own page](../input) has everything you need to build.

**Three easy ways in**

- Start with the drawing. Each number is one part, and the legend beside it names it.
- Want to know why a part looks the way it does? Its card follows the decision from the answer about the product, through the rule and the token, to what you see.
- Or start from a job, like Focus or Emphasis, and find every part that does it in the legend.

Come back whenever a part makes you wonder why.
:::

## Design roles

Each part does a job for the person. These are the jobs, as questions the part answers.

- **Containment** What holds this?
- **Layering** What sits on top?
- **Hierarchy** What do you read first?
- **Readability** Can you read it?
- **Emphasis** Where does the eye go?
- **Meaning** What state is it in?
- **Affordance** Can you act on it?
- **Feedback** Did it respond?
- **Focus** Where is the keyboard?
- **Grouping** What belongs together?
- **Reach** Can you hit it?

## The parts

![Input, every part numbered](/anatomy/content-first/input/stage.png)

*Content first, light, drawn in Figma from the scheme's tokens.*

Legend: every part and its roles. The numbers match the drawing; a part without one isn't in this example.

:label[By scheme]{tone="info"} Its value changes by scheme. The part is the same in every scheme.

- **1** **Field** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Affordance] :label[Reach] :label[Containment]
- **2** **Value and placeholder** required :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Readability]
- **3** **Focus ring** state :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Focus]
- **4** **Invalid field** state :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Meaning] :label[Feedback]
- **5** **Disabled field** state :label[By scheme]{tone="info"} :label[Feedback]

## How the decisions reach each part

Each part follows a chain: an answer about the product, the rule it set, the token that carries it, and the value you see. The numbers match the drawing.

:::panel{id="part-1" title="Field" note="Parts 1"}
![Field: 1](/anatomy/content-first/input/card-1.png)

:label[Affordance] :label[Reach]

- **Answer** Shape · What should control corners say? → Rounded

  Rounded corners feel friendly.

- **Answer** Accessibility · What is the smallest target? → Touch size

  Readers are often on phones.

- **Rule** For corners of buttons and inputs, use radius.control (rounded). Don't use sharp corners.

  Rounded corners match the warm reading tone. Sharp corners feel technical next to long text.

- **Rule** For the smallest clickable thing, use size.control.default (touch). Don't use a compact control.

  Many readers are on phones.

- **Token** `size.control.default` → `height` 3rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** size.48

- **Token** `radius.control` → `radius` 0.5rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** radius.8: Rounded corners feel friendly.

- **Token** `space.inset.control-x` → `padding-x` 1.25rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** space.20

:::panel{id="part-2" title="Value and placeholder" note="Parts 2"}
![Value and placeholder: 2](/anatomy/content-first/input/card-2.png)

:label[Readability]

- **Answer** Typography · How large is body text? → Large

  Large body text is easy on the eyes.

- **Rule** For field label or column header, use type.label. Don't use type.caption.

  Caption is too faint for a label people must read.

- **Token** `color.text.primary` → `text` #1F1B16 · dark #FFFDF8 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Body text and headings.

  - **Pick** neutral.900: the strongest text step, 17.12:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.
  - **Dark** neutral.900: the strongest text step, 16.84:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.inverse. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.text.primary.

- **Token** `color.text.muted` → `placeholder` #61594D · dark #A39A8B :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  The quietest text.

  - **Pick** neutral.600: the quietest text that still reads, 6.9:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.
  - **Dark** neutral.400: the quietest text that still reads, 6.16:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.

- **Token** `type.body.font-size` → `font-size` 1.125rem :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** font.size.18

:::panel{id="part-3" title="Focus ring" note="Parts 3"}
![Focus ring: 3](/anatomy/content-first/input/card-3.png)

:label[Focus]

- **Answer** Accessibility · What contrast floor do we hold? → AA

  AA contrast, with large text helping further.

- **Rule** For keyboard focus, use button/focus-ring at border-width.focus. Don't use removing the outline.

  Keyboard users must always see where they are.

- **Token** `color.border.focus` → `border.focus` #1E3A5F · dark #8FA6C4 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  The focus ring.

  - **Pick** navy.light.600: the focus ring, so the keyboard's place is never lost, 11.5:1 on surface.default, above the 3:1 floor.
  - **Dark** navy.dark.600: the focus ring, so the keyboard's place is never lost, 6.86:1 on surface.default, above the 3:1 floor.
  - **Shares the step with** border.selected, action.primary, category.1. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.border.focus.

- **Token** `border-width.focus` → `focus` 2px :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  - **Pick** border-width.2

- **Token** `border-width.focus-offset` → `focus-offset` 2px

  - **Pick** border-width.2

:::panel{id="part-4" title="Invalid field" note="Parts 4"}
![Invalid field: 4](/anatomy/content-first/input/card-4.png)

:label[Meaning] :label[Feedback]

- **Answer** Accessibility · How many signals carry each meaning? → Two: color and word

  Status is rare; color and a word are enough.

- **Rule** For an error message, use color.status.danger and a plain sentence. Don't use color alone.

  The sentence says what to fix; color only draws the eye.

- **Token** `color.status.danger` → `border.invalid` #C42B2B · dark #F28B8B :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Real risk: errors, failed checks, actions that cannot be undone. The top of the urgency order. Overuse wears it out.

  - **Pick** red.light.600: danger reads as text and icons, 5.63:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.
  - **Dark** red.dark.600: danger reads as text and icons, 7.21:1 on surface.default, above the 4.5:1 floor.
  - **Shares the step with** action.danger. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.status.danger.

:::panel{id="part-5" title="Disabled field" note="Parts 5"}
![Disabled field: 5](/anatomy/content-first/input/card-5.png)

:label[Feedback]

- **Answer** Accessibility · Which states get their own visible value? → Those and pressed

  Pressed gets its own value for touch.

- **Token** `color.disabled.surface` → `disabled.background` #F6F2EA · dark #2E2A24 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  The fill of a control that cannot be used right now.

  - **Pick** neutral.100: the surface of a control that cannot be used, flat and quiet, so it never reads as an action.
  - **Dark** neutral.100: the surface of a control that cannot be used, flat and quiet, so it never reads as an action.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.sunken, surface.highlight, action.secondary.hover, category.5.subtle. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.disabled.surface.

- **Token** `color.disabled.border` → `disabled.border` #E4DDD0 · dark #4A4339 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  The edge of a control that cannot be used right now.

  - **Pick** neutral.200: the border of a control that cannot be used, flat and quiet, so it never reads as an action.
  - **Dark** neutral.200: the border of a control that cannot be used, flat and quiet, so it never reads as an action.
  - **Shares the step with** surface.pressed, border.default. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.disabled.border.

- **Token** `color.disabled.text` → `disabled.text` #7A7062 · dark #CFC6B6 :label[By scheme]{tone="info"}

  Text and icons of a control that cannot be used right now.

  - **Pick** neutral.500: 4.86:1 on surface.default, under the floor on purpose, so the control reads as unavailable. Disabled text has no contrast minimum.
  - **Dark** neutral.500: 10.11:1 on surface.default, under the floor on purpose, so the control reads as unavailable. Disabled text has no contrast minimum.
  - **Shares the step with** border.strong, category.5. Changing this pick moves only what reads color.disabled.text.

## For agents

Agents get this same anatomy: every part, its roles, whether it is required, the tokens it reads and the decisions behind them.

- **From an AI agent:** call the `get_anatomy` tool on the Open DS MCP server, with this scheme and `input`.
- **From a terminal:** `npx open-ds anatomy content-first input`
